<h1>WML overview</h1>

<p>WML is based on the eXtensible Markup Language (XML) and was developed by the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) Forum.

<p>WML, like HTML, is a type of markup language used for formatting content in
mobile devices. WML is
very similar to HTML except for some key differences:
<ul>
<li><b>Cards</b>. 
With WML, each page, called a deck, is broken down into several small cards. While 
 the deck is downloaded from the server all at once, cards are displayed 
 one at a time. This  is done to acquire small screen size.
The card specifies a single interaction between the user agent and the user. Cards are grouped together into
  decks, the
top-most element of a wml document.&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Soft keys</b>. Soft keys are device buttons that can be assigned various
  functions.</li>
<li><b>Wireless bitmap images</b>. Because of the small display area on mobile devices, images tend to be small.
  Mobile phone displays vary in size from roughly<br>
  80 x 60 pixel areas to 100 x 100, or more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since 
 WML is based on XML, it is a very strict language. All 
 tags must be in lowercase and they must all be closed in order for the 
 code to be well-formed and run correctly.<br>
The Wireless Markup Language is a page description language that describes how WAP content is presented to the user. With WML you can display information on a
mobile phone, give the user input options, and specify how the user agent should
respond when the user activates a user interface function or presses a key.
