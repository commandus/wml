phrase list. First line indicates date and time when this listing was created.
Each line below the first line consists of number (ordered form 1), tabulator
symbol and relative or absolute path of the file. For example, this is short
listing:</p>

listing file. To do that, click <b>...</b> button to browse folders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In case of listing file does not exists, you are prompted to create new ones.
Press &quot;Yes&quot; to include all files recursively (in other words, include

selected directory.&nbsp;</p>

Project window will be included in the new created listing.</p>
<p>If you would like include more files, you can use Find text dialog. Find text
dialog have option to scan directories and create listing file. Also you can
specify text to find in documents, so you may omit some documents from listing.</p>

listing file. There are no matter of&nbsp; number of file, also you can leave
date and time stamp in the merged listing. Please note that just first line
