 <img border="0" src="oimg.gif" width="24" height="24">
<br id=imgbrief>Indicates that an image is to be included in the text flow. Image layout is done within the context of normal text layout. The image must be formatted as either a .jpg, .gif, or .png.
<br>You can specify image sizes as percentages of the active area of the page, as pixel counts.
<br>Width and height attributes expressed as percentages are treated as percentages with respect to the block element immediately containing them, which is often the page area. Pixel-based sizes are
generally discouraged because the resulting layout does not scale well as the content is moved to different sized displays, or is rendered together with different user-chosen font-sizes.
