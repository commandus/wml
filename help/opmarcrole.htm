<p class="attributevalue">The normative list of values used for the <span class="attrnormal">role</span> attribute is defined by the MARC relator code list (<a href="http://www.loc.gov/marc/relators/">http://www.loc.gov/marc/relators/</a>).
When roles are specified, the 3-character registered MARC values <span class="mustmay">must</span> be used when applicable. Although that list is extensive, other values <span class="mustmay">may</span>
be added if a required role is not covered by those predefined values. Such values <span class="mustmay">must</span> begin with “oth.”, and shall be considered subdivisions of the “other”
relator code. Like other constructs in this specification, these values are case-sensitive and <span class="mustmay">must</span> be coded entirely in lower-case.</p>
