<p><a name="encode">WML Encoders and Decoders</a>
</p>
<p>The editor provides an encoder for converting textual WML content to binary format for transmission over a wireless network. Conversely, its<br>
decoder converts received binary content to text for display on the text editor panel. This feature is provided for calculation of the deck size.
</p>
<p><a name="unicode">Unicode support</a>
</p>
<p>The editor provides clear way to write text in different languages. Just switch a keyboard to correct language and type a text, no additional conversion to &amp;#; sequences is required.
