<br id=selectbrief>The select element lets users pick from a list of options. Each option is specified by an option element. Each option element may have one line of formatted text. Option elements may be organised into hierarchical groups using the optgroup element.

<p id=selectattr>
  <b>name</b>
  <br>Specifies the name of the variable to set with the result of the selection. The name variable's value is used to pre-load the text entry object.
  <br><b>value</b>
  <br>Indicates the default value of the variable named in the name attribute. When the element is displayed, and the variable named in the name attribute is not set, the name variable may be assigned the value specified in the value attribute, depending on the values defined in iname and
  ivalue. If the name variable already contains a value, the value attribute is ignored. Any application of the default value is done before the list is pre-selected with the value of the name variable. If this element allows the selection of multiple options, the result of the user's choice is a list of all selected values, separated by the semicolon character. The name variable is set with this result. Similarly, the value attribute is interpreted as a semicolon-separated list of pre-selected options.
  <br><b>iname</b>
  <br>Indicates the name of the variable to be set with the index result of the selection. The index result is the position of the currently selected option in the select list. An index of zero indicates that no option is selected. Index numbering begins at one and increases monotonically.
  <br><b>ivalue</b>
  <br>Indicates the default-selected option element. When the element is displayed, if the variable named in the iname attribute is not set, it is assigned the default-selected entry. If the variable already contains a value, the ivalue attribute is ignored. If the iname attribute is not specified, the ivalue value is applied every time the element is displayed. If this element allows the selection of multiple options, the index result of the user's choice is a list of the indices of all the selected options, separated by the semicolon character. The iname variable is set with this result. Similarly, the ivalue attribute is interpreted as a semicolon-separated list of pre-selected options.
  <br><b>multiple</b>
  <br>Indicates that the select list should accept multiple selections. When not set, the select list should only accept a single selected option. Default is false.
  <br><b>tabindex</b>
  <br>Specifies the tabbing position of the current element. The tabbing position indicates the relative order in which elements are traversed when tabbing within a single WML card.
  <br><b>title</b>
  <br>Specifies a title for this element, which may be used in the presentation of this object.
  <br><b>id</b>
  <br>Provides an element with a unique name within a single deck.
  <br><b>class</b>
  <br>Affiliates an element with one or more classes.
  <br><b>xml:lang</b>
  <br>Specifies the natural or formal language in which the document is written.
