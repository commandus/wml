<h1>Automatic entity conversion on loading and saving</h1>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When it is required, you may use character
entities instead of input characters directly. For instance, if you are prefer
to use specific code page (instead of more universal
Unicode) you are limited by given character encoding. Character entities are a character encoding-independent
mechanism for entering any character from the document character set. Entities
are designed for use in non-Unicode encoded documents.&nbsp;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"> In WML all numeric character
entities are referenced with respect to the Unicode and not to the current document
encoding (charset). This means that alpha (first letter in Greek alphabet) can
be represented as &amp;#x3B1; (hexadecimal Unicode number) or &amp;#945;
(decimal Unicode number) and these numbers always
refers to the alpha, independent of the current character encoding. This means
also that you can use Greek characters in your document encoded in the iso-8859-1
or us-ascii but not exactly iso-8859-7 (Greek encoding) with entities.</p>

<p> Please note it is more easy to use UTF-8 encoding because you are input any
characters directly (or choose them from the <a href="howtosymbol.htm"> Insert a
special symbol dialog</a>. If you prefer to
use a particular code page, please see list of&nbsp; <a href="codepages.htm">Supported
code pages</a>.
</p>

<p> The editor displays Unicode characters well so it is possible to represent
glyphs instead of Unicode numbers. It means that all numeric entities 'll be
replaced to the Unicode characters after document is loaded. By default editor
do not that. To enable this feature, you must enter to the <i>Editor Options</i>
dialog, select <i>Auto conversion</i> tab sheet and mark <i>Replace entities to
characters</i>, as
shown below.&nbsp;
</p>

</p>

<p>Also, if you would like save any non-ASCII characters as numeric entities,
you must enter to the <i>Editor Options</i> dialog, select <i>Auto conversion</i>
tab sheet and mark <i>Replace all non-ASCII characters to entities</i>.
</p>

<p>As you can see, there are two additional options: <i>Numeric entities are
referenced with respect to the document encoding (charset)</i> for loading and
saving document both. WML documentation declares that all numeric character entities are referenced with respect to the
document character set (Unicode) and not to the current document encoding (charset).
But if there are some documents you have use numeric character entities are referenced with respect to the document encoding
(charset), you can load them correctly (mark first checkbox) and than save it.
This procedure will fix documents with incorrect entities.
</p>

<p>And, if you would like save in use numeric character entities are referenced with respect to the document encoding
(charset), mark second checkbox.
</p>

<p>Note that both <i>Numeric entities are referenced with respect to the
document encoding (charset)</i> options are valid if appropriate <i>Replace ..</i>
option is marked.
