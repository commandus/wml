<h1>WAP Overview</h1>
<p>WAP (Wireless Application Protocol) is a standard 
 protocol used to access the web content and applications from mobile phones and
other wireless devices. Requests are made through the mobile device's browser with WAP to a Wireless Gateway,
connected to the Internet and forwards the request 
 using HTTP to a web server. The Web server returns the information formatted with the
<a href="wmloverview.htm"> WML</a> markup language.
<p>In most cases, the actual content or web application is
located on a web server and this content is created in WML. User
interacts with web server as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The user presses a phone key that has an URL request assigned to it;</li>
  <li>
    The user agent sends an URL request to a WAP gateway using the WAP;
   </li>
  <li>
    The WAP gateway sends request to the web server;
   </li>
  <li>
    The HTTP request is processed by the web server;
   </li>
  <li>
    The web server returns the wml deck (document of text/wml MIME type);
   </li>
  <li>
    The WAP gateway encodes wml deck to binary (compiled) wmlc and sends it to the user
    agent;
   </li>
  <li>
    The user agent receives the wmlc and displays the first card of the wml deck to the user.
   </li>
</ul>
