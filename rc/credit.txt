Many years ago,

the Jedi Master

known only as

"The Wireless Apoo"

grew up to become

Jedi Council.



Years later, 

The Dark Apoo

trained a padawan

who succumbed to

the Dark Side of

the Force.



He became Apoo Ed

the "Jedi Killer" bounty hunter.


Shortly after THE PHANTOM MENACE, 

he traveled to Tatooine 

to find out the truth about Sharad Hett. 

Sharad had become leader of a band of 

Tusken Raiders.


Many years later, Anakin Skywalker

becomes Darth Vader. 

Vader hunts down The Dark 

Apoo and after a fierce battle,

kills him.
