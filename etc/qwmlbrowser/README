QWmlbrowser beta release 
------------------------

This project is an open source projet.
This is the initial development release. This browser is a base for a wml browser.
For the moment the functionalities are a little bit limited but they will be extended quickly.
Basically, you can browse local files with rendering of text, picture (wmbp), link.

For the moment, there is no network connection but direct http request will arrive soon  (i just need to understand how to plug an http class to a QmimeSource) and a link to a waptack is planned with our other project called waplinux (www.waplinux.org).

To compile the browser, just type make and launch it with ./qwmlbrowser. You just need to have QT library installed into your system (not the snapshot version qt-3.x.x). Some examples are provided for testing (webcab directory).


Any bugs, issues of feature requests should be sent to bug@wmlbrowser.org.
If you want to contribute to this project or need more informations, send an e-mail to stephanl@5nine.net.
New versions will be available soon into our cvs  or in our website (www.wmlbrowser.org).

------

This browser uses QT librairy (www.trolltech.com); so it should be able to be compiled and run with several platfporms. 

The architecture is not really definitve because, i wrote the browser and learned QT at the same time so some pieces of codes would be moved (especially the parser part which could handled by defining a new Style Sheet instead coding a class for Wml parsing). 


This browser contains theses main classes:
	- qbrowser: the mainwindow of the browser,
	- qwmlbrowser: the widget for wml rendering,
	- wmlparser : parser for wml,
	- qhttp : http request (taken from the qt snapshot) need to be bound with QmimeSource for direct http requests.


other files :
	- wbmp : add support to QT for wbmp format (just reading).
