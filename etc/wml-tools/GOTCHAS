Gotcha #1: XML, not SGML

You can run into problems if you ever forget that WML is an XML
language, not a plain SGML language. If you find your pages won't
parse or display properly, make sure that standalone tags have a
trailing slash in their name like <br/>.

Workaround:

Check your own code!

Gotcha #2: No "back" button ... or is there

In a HTML browser there is always a facility to go backwards through
the stack of visited pages, but a WAP browser promises no such
feature. To get around this, you can implement your own global "back"
button with the deck template and the <prev/> tag.

However, the Nokia WAP Toolkit shows a problem with this - some WAP
browsers do have a back button. Nokia's toolkit shows two (fictional)
phones, the 6150 and the 6110. The 6150 has no back button at all,
while the 6110's action button changes to a back button after 2
seconds inactivity. This means that if you implement a global back
button for all browsers, on the larger browsers there will be two
visible.

Workaround:

It's probably possible to implement some WMLscript for this purpose,
but that seems like a bit of overkill.

Gotcha #3: Mishandled URLs

While playing with the Ericsson WAP SDK I noticed that it doesn't handle
some URLs properly. I had written several small files called "1.wml"
through to "12.wml" and had used <a href="1.wml"> to reference them.
However, Ericsson's virtual phone told me that it didn't know what
protocol to use.

If a URL begins with a number it appears that it forgets what protocol
(http, local file) it uses and the path.

Workaround:

Don't start URLs with numbers. Or don't use Ericsson R320S mobile phones
to view your WAP pages.
