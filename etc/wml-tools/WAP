WML stands for Wireless Markup Language, a sort of slimmed version of
HTML intended for small, portable devices such as WAP enabled mobile
phones. WAP stands for Wireless Access Protocol and is the low level
protocol used by these devices to send and receive.

In general, a WAP device will request data from a WAP gateway which
will translate the requests from the WAP device to valid Internet
protocols and also translate the response :

                    Wireless Network          Wired Network
       WAP-enabled  <-------------->    WAP   <----------->  Server
         device           WAP         gateway      IP

What this translates to in the real world is that when a WAP device
requests a WML deck, the WAP gateway sends (usually) an HTTP request
to the server for the WML source, compiles it into bytecode and sends
this back to the WAP device.
