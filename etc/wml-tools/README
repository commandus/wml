wml-tools v0.0.4 (31/1/2000)

This is the latest release of wml-tools. At the moment it only contains a
WBMP viewer, a simple WML bytecode decoder, a very simple WML deck
viewer and a tempremental WML to HTML converter.

Also included as a bonus is a Netscape RDF to WML deck converter. Vital to
get the /. headlines on your WAP device.

It seems to work on a few Linux boxes I have access to (Slackware 3.6,
4.0, 7.0, Redhat 5.2) and I should be able to test it elsewhere soon. If
it doesn't compile for you, let me know what setup you have and I'll see
about fixing it.

These tools require libxml and libz (which libxml requires). The configure
script and makefiles are still as dire as ever but should be replaced by
something better soon. Compilation should just be a matter of ./configure
then make.

There is a README file in each tool's directory to give some notes and
instructions.

In the samples directory are some WML decks I used to teach myself the
basics of WML - they should be of some use in understanding the layout of
WML files.

The bugs are being squashed steadily.

Feedback on these tools are always welcome. Send any comments, queries,
bugfixes or BNL guitar tab to the address at the bottom of the file. Keep
any spam and flames to yourself or forever be consigned to /dev/null.
