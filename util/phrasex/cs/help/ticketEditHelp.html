<b>How to assign or close this request</b><br/>
To assign this request, go back to the request detail page and click
the Assign command. To close this request, go back to the request
detail page and click the Close command.<br/>
<b>Why am I not seeing all products</b><br/>
You can view all 'public' and 'private' products that you have purchased. Go to
the Sales Manager to register a private 
product under your name. Once you have done so, this product should be visible
in all product lists.

<br/>
<b>Different types of notes</b><br/>
Public notes are visible to all users. Internal notes are only
visible to staff members and managers. 

<br/>
<b>Co-submitter Email</b><br/>
A person who submitted a request may want all communications 
to be copied to other people. This works like the Cc: field
of an email. You can enter multiple email addresses separated
by commas.<br/>
<b>Submitted To</b>
<br/>
The "Submitted To" field identifies the staff member who entered a request, received
over the phone or by fax, for an End User.
