<b>Tabular Report</b><br/>
List records that match your conditions. Report 
layout is coded in RepTabRun.htm. Report conditions can be saved. 
<br/>
<b>Crosstab Report</b><br/>
Display statistics based on your conditions. Report 
layout is coded in RepCroRun.htm. Report conditions can be saved.

<b>Custom Report</b><br/>
Custom designed report. Report layout and conditions 
are all coded in SSP files you write. 
<br/>
To add a custom report to the system, you need to write the 
report in a new SSP file using SSP and HTML, then use the New Custom 
Report command in the Report Manager to add it. 
RepMan.htm is the template behind the Report 
Manager. See the pre-built webroot/hd/report/customReport1.htm 
for a real life example of how a custom report can work.
