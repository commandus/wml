<b>Respond vs. Edit</b><br/>
The &quot;Respond&quot; command allows you to respond to a request by entering a
note. Both the &quot;Respond&quot; command and the &quot;Edit&quot; command
allow you to enter a note. The difference between these commands is that the
note entered from the &quot;Respond&quot; command will be sent to its submitters
by email when the Email Sender is enabled. In addition, the note is always a
public one and is visible to the submitter. 

<br/>
<b>Divide command</b><br/>
Often, people submit a request with multiple questions. They may also ask a new
question unrelated to a previous one. The Divide command allows you to create a
new request based on the current one. That way, you can allocate one question
per request. <b>Note, the Divide command will bring up a new window. If you
don't see it, check the Taskbar.</b>

<br/>
<b>
Co-submitter Email
</b><br/>
A person who submitted a request may want all communications to be copied to
other people. This works like the Cc: field of an email. You can enter multiple
email addresses separated by commas.

<br/>
<b>Submitted To</b>
<br/>
The &quot;Submitted To&quot; field corresponds to the staff member who entered
the request, received over the phone or by fax, for an End User.
