<b>Public and private products</b><br/>
Public products are visible to everyone. Private products are
visible only to staff members, managers and end users
who have purchased them. 
<br/>
For example, you might have a product
called "MS Word&quot;. If John is an end user who owns a copy
of MS Word, then there is a "MS Word" product
registered under John in Product Registratrion.
John will be able to see "MS Word" in all product lists.
<br/>
<b>Product dispatcher</b><br/>
A product dispatcher is responsible for dispatching requests
to appropriate people to work on. Requests escalated by the 
Escalator will be sent to the corresponding dispatcher. New requests
may be assigned to the dispatcher depending on the routing rules.
