<b>When notification emails are sent</b>
<br/>
If you have enabled the Email Sender on the Tasks Page of Perfect
Tracker Manager, Server, Settings, notifications of request submission,
assignment and closure will be sent by email.
A notification email will not be sent if the receiver does not have an email 
address setup in his/her user account.
<ol>
<li>
When a request is submitted, a notification email may be sent according
to the new request dispatching rules for the product. To edit the 
dispatching rule, go to Product Manager and click the Edit 
command. A confirmation email is also sent back to the request 
submitters.
<li>
When a request is assigned, a notification email is sent to the user specified
in the "Assigned To&quot; field. If a request is reassigned to another user, a
notification email is also sent to the user the request was originally assigned
to.
<li>
When a request is responded to using the Respond command, a notification email
is sent to the submitter.
<li>
When a new note is entered by the submitter, a notification email is sent to the
user specified in the "Assigned To" field.
<li>
When a request is closed, the resolution is sent to all submitters
and the user specified in the "Submitted To" field.
</ol>
Submitters include users specified in the "Submitted By", "Co-Submitter" and "Submitter
Cc&quot; fields.
The "Submitted To" field corresponds to the staff member who entered the request received,
over the phone or by fax, for someone else. 

<br/>
<b>Excessive Email Suppression</b>
<br/>
In order to avoid generating excessive notification emails, this system has a
mechanism which suppresses emails sent to yourself due to your own actions. You
know what you did and you don't need an additional notification.
<ol>
  <li>If you are a Staff Member or a Manager and you submit a request yourself,
    you won't receive a notification. (However, you will if you are an End User
    or if someone else submitted the request for you.)
  <li>If you assign a request explicitly to yourself, you won't receive an
    assignment notification. However, if you submit a request on a product where
    you are the dispatcher, and you are assigned the request due to the
    &quot;new request dispatching rule&quot;, you will receive an assignment
    notification.
  <li>If you reassign a request originally assigned to you, you won't receive a
    confirmation email notifying you that you are no longer responsible for the
    request.
  <li>If you respond to a request you submitted, you won't receive an email
    notification.
  <li>If you close a request you submitted, you won't receive a notification
    email regarding the resolution.</li>
