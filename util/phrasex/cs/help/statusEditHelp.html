The status with the smallest sequence number and the status with the largest
sequence number are used by the system. When a request is submitted, it is given
the status with the smallest sequence number. Also, when you enter a Resolution
on the New Request page, the system closes this request immediately by assigning&nbsp;
it the status with the largest sequence number.
<br/>When saving changes to a request, if the system detects that the status for
this request has been changed to the status with the largest sequence number, it
considers this request closed and sets the ClosedBy field to the current user
and the ClosedOn field to the current time. If the system detects that the
status for this request has been changed to the status with the smallest
sequence number, it considers the request reopened.
